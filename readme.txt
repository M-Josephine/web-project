This project is a side project aiming to practice html/css and GIT. After having worked on classification algoritms to predict wine quality (https://github.com/M-Josephine/wine_quality_classification_ML), I am creating a website to display the results and predict the quality of a wine according to user's inputs (wine properties). The target could be winemakers or wine experts.
